# Unit-Converter-Project



DESCRIPTION:

Hey There developers, this project is a based on a prgram which is called Unit converter, wbout which we will discuss about further.


This was one of the few projects that I built during my second semester.
The language used is C and its a simple project that converts the given input into a favourable unit, let it be temperature, mass or currency.


The goal was to show that at this intermidiate level of studying this language, I was able to built it with my own logic as well as some outside help.


Firstly, I had to think about all the variables and the libraries that I was going to need.
Then comes the Logic of the program on how to start the initial stage ofthe unit converter project.


DevC/C++ was used as the platform to develop the project.
Then as the project moved on, I had to build the steps or algorithm on what to show, how the user can select if he/she wants to select temperature, currency or mass.


After the step, I moved to the nxt that was to ensure that every unit, as specified from college, was in the program so that user can have the access to change from one unit to another... lets say from celcius to fahreinheit or fahreinheit to celcius.


The same process was used in mass and currency conversion.
In the currency division, we can see USD, JPY and RMB, the respective currency of America, Japan and China.

A normal concept of nested if else was used to whether the user will choose depending upon their need.
